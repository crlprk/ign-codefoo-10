# IGN CodeFoo 10 Application
### Submitted by Carlson Park

**Hello Team IGN**

Thank you for your time to review my application into the 2022 IGN Code Foo Program.

All required tasks are within their respective folders in this repository.

[IGN Code Foo 2022](https://www.ign.com/code-foo/2022) - Program application details.


This application process was personally very fulfilling. Though experienced in creating front end designs and implementing them, implementing a video player was a first for me. Though frustrating at times (especially creating custom components for video-js), I've learned a lot throughout the application process about my skills as a developer and about new technologies to use in my future projects.

## 1. Introduction
Introduce yourself, explain your connection to IGN, and tell us why we should pick you to participate in IGNâ€™s Code Foo program. Show your enthusiasm and passion for IGN in the form of a YouTube/Vimeo video, written document, audio track, or whatever format you feel most comfortable with.

## 2. Hisui's New Power Plant
Requested By: Professor Laventon

The Galaxy Team has decided that in order to advance the research on Pokemon and the Pokedex, Jubilife village needs a brand new power plant. Luckily, Professor Laventon has discovered that the Pokemon, Voltorb, is the best candidate to help power the village.

Voltorbs can cleanly and efficiently produce electricity. An average Voltorb is about 0.5m (1'08") tall and weighs 10.4 kg (22.8lbs). However, they are uncommon and are only found in the Sacred Plaza.

Objective: How many Voltorbs will you need to catch to fully power the village. Describe each step in your thought process.

## 3. Front End Project
**Design Specifications ([Reference Image](https://media.ignimgs.com/code-foo/2020/images/cfx_video_mock.jpg)):**
1. Create a responsive, single-page web app for IGN video playlists based on the UI design mock below, using this API.
2. Include a video player area, stylized video controls, and the playlist queue. Implementing the IGN header and top navigation bar is not necessary.
3. Load the first video in the playlist into the video element on initial page load. There is no need to autoplay the first video, allow the user to initialize it on their own. After each video finishes playback, start playing the next video in the list until all videos have completed.

**Bonus Features:** 
* Responsive mobile first design with 2 breakpoints:
    * Mobile UI based on IGN Website and App Development Project
    * Tablet UI based on Youtube Tablet App
* Description - Show more functionality
    * Show more button similar to Youtube's video player for longer video descriptions
* End of Playlist indicator
* Navigation bar placeholder

Setup and Build instructions are in Front End Project folder
