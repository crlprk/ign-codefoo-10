These were the words that shined across the tiny LCD screen of my Nintendo DS as I began my journey into the world of video games. Bundled tight by warm blankets and huddled on top of a cushy bed, I was entranced by the simple pixel art monsters as they danced across my screen. Since this moment, video games have been influential in my life. They were my first experience with using technology to create not just entertainment but an experience.

To those reading this application, I would like to introduce myself. My name is Carlson Park. I am a high school student with a passion for creating new experiences with technology. I have always been a creative individual, always looking for ways to create something new with whatever resources were present at that moment. To a child with such an insatiable creative urge, the introduction to the world of programming was as if the floodgates of possibility were opened.

As the years went on, I grew more and more versed in the realm of computing. I learned to build my own computers and electronics to suit my needs, to use digital art and 3d modeling software to express my ideas visually, to utilize AI/ML algorithms to predict, recognize, and generate content, to use various languages such as Python, Java, C#, Javascript to solve and automate problems, and more. And throughout these years, my interest in video games never waned.

Now as I reach a new phase of my life, transitioning from a high school student to venturing into college and then the real working world, I'm looking to experience working in a real production environment to further my skills as a developer and improve my ability to work with a team to achieve goals no one person could dream of. I hope through the hands-on experience of an internship, along with valuable mentorship from professionals provided by this program, I can advance and better myself not only as a developer but as an individual.

## My connection to IGN
My first introduction to IGN was through playthrough guides for Pokemon Platinum on the NDS. With help from the IGN guide in conjunction with my Pokemon Platinum Strategy guide, I was able to traverse the region of Sinnoh and beat the Elite 4 Champion. My experiences with IGN only grew from there. From 7/10 reviews with too much water to breaking news from the gaming and entertainment industry, IGN has always been a part of my gaming life. IGN has introduced me to various new genres and franchises that I hold dearly and was one of the first to announce news about exciting new releases that I had been awaiting for months.

It was Pokemon that introduced me to IGN, and it seems fitting that Pokemon-related questions would appear on my application to the IGN Code Foo Program. 
## Why me?
I believe even despite my younger age, I am an exceptional candidate for the 2022 Code Foo program. As a motivated individual, I always strive to be the best in any interest I pursue. Academically, I consistently achieve the highest marks and wish to extend this level of achievement to software development. I believe that the Code Foo Program is just the opportunity to fulfill my desire to learn. 

As a high school student, I have not yet had many experiences working in a professional environment. However, working in a team isn't foreign to me, and I look forward to learning from both mentors and peers if accepted into the program. 

I have experience in coding languages such as Java, Javascript, C#, and Python and experience in various digital disciplines ranging from video game development to AI/ML development. I possess the skills to work in a production environment, but also understand that I have much more to learn as a software engineer. 

I would be honored to be considered for a position in the 2022 IGN Code Foo Internship Program and hope to hear back from you soon.
